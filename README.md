Tiny Crossing
===============================

This is based on the classic arcade game Frogger. Upon choosing a character 
sprite, you move around with the arrow keys, avoid enemies, collect gems and 
keys to earn points and advance harder levels. To play, all you have to do is

## Compatibility

**Please note that this game is only known to be fully compatible with Chrome 
and Firefox browsers.** 

If you are on Windows the game should also work on Opera browser but it does not
appear to work on Opera running on Ubuntu. 

The game does work on the latest version of IE and on Edge, but there are 
optimization problems present for these browsers. While these are issues I hope 
to address in time, Chrome and Firefox already give an optimal experience, so 
please use these if they are available options for you!

## Game Objective

Avoid the enemies. Avoid the water. Collect the three keys at the top of the 
screen to advance to the next round. Collect the keys before the timer on the 
top left runs out to collect a lot of extra points. 

The best scores that I tend to get are just over 9000, so if you can crack 10000 
you are probably pretty good at this game.

There are a lot of gems floating around the game that are worth picking up for 
power up boosts that make completing the objective of gathering the keys much 
easier and faster. See the game browser screen for a hint as to what each of the 
power ups actually do.

## Controls

Use **arrow keys** to move around.

Use **enter key** to advance past an announcement screen.

Use **p key** to pause the game.

Use **m key** to mute sounds.

## Planned features

Though I am done the initial round of development for this game I do plan to 
come back to it to add some things and fix some others. Here is an incomplete 
list of the planned changes:

- Add compatibility for Opera on Ubuntu
- Optimization for IE and Edge
- Scoreboard
- Mouse controls at least for the player selection screen
- Sliding menus for the information on either side of the game inside the 
browser.
