## Play

This is based on the classic arcade game Frogger. To play, all you have to do is
[click here.](http://andreicommunication.github.io/tiny-crossing) This was
developed as part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree and is a 
project designed to assist me as I learn JavaScript and using [pseudoclassical classes.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9DY2TtWbI29KSEIot1WXRqqao7OCd7OOC2W3oubSmc/pub?embedded=true#h.lf0pgel7i8pr)

## Compatibility

**Please note that this game is only known to be fully compatible with Chrome 
and Firefox browsers.** 

If you are on Windows the game should also work on Opera browser but it does not
appear to work on Opera running on Ubuntu. 

The game does work on the latest version of IE and on Edge, but there are 
optimization problems present for these browsers. While these are issues I hope 
to address in time, Chrome and Firefox already give an optimal experience, so 
please use these if they are available options for you!

## Game Objective and Tips

Select a character sprite using arrow keys and choose it by pressing **enter**.

Avoid the enemies. Avoid the water. Collect the three keys at the top of the 
screen to advance to the next round. Collect the keys before the timer on the 
top left runs out to collect a lot of extra points. 

The best scores that I tend to get are just over 9000, so if you can crack 10000 
you are probably pretty good at this game.

There are a lot of gems floating around the game that are worth picking up for 
power up boosts that make completing the objective of gathering the keys much 
easier and faster. See the game browser screen for a hint as to what each of the 
power ups actually do.

## Controls

Use **arrow keys** to move around.

Use **enter key** to advance past an announcement screen or to select a 
character.

Use **p key** to pause the game.

Use **m key** to mute sounds.

## Planned features

Though I am done the initial round of development for this game I do plan to 
come back to it to add some things and fix some others. Here is an incomplete 
list of the planned changes:

- Add compatibility for Opera on Ubuntu
- Optimization for IE and Edge
- Scoreboard
- Mouse controls at least for the player selection screen
- Sliding menus for the information on either side of the game inside the 
browser. 
- Fix occasional corn bunching at start up.

I'm happy to receive suggestions on how best to implement these planned
features. If you feel there is a great solution that I ought to include, please 
contact me at Andrei.Borissenko@gmail.com

## Issues

Occasionally the corn will load incorrectly and bunch up into each other when 
the game loads for the first time, this gets corrected by reloading the page.
